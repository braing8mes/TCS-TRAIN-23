My name is Aditi and i just wanted to say a huge thank you to you for giving us so much of you time to help us learn more about a developing, newer generation of computing. it really helped me because this helps me to understand more about this field of computing and how science can be used in it.

To me, a good teacher is the most important part of a course. I thrive when the teacher's puts efforts into what they are doing and when they are not, I am directly impacted negatively.

I am very happy to say that this course was such a great experience for me because of our lab TA! He was a not only great at what he was doing, he was also passionate about answering all our crazy questions. I never once felt scared of asking a crazy question, because with time I realized that I will be only be answered with kindness.

I learn through questioning, and I learned a lot thanks to Alex! I can't thank him enough.  Looking forward to the next semester, hope our TA is the same for the next semester as well! 

I am super grateful all the people that made the course possible! Me and my little sisters enjoyed it here a lot. We all were in separate lab groups but we all had only praises to sing about this course haha.

* Being able to rewatch lectures and labs

* Being able to ask questions live during office hours

* Having someone walk through the homework (homework review)",0.0,"* Right now, the ONLY place to get your questions answered by staff is during office hours. This is not good enough since, if you are not able to attend the office hours live, you have no other options. Instead, for people who cannot attend the scheduled office hours, there needs to be a forum where you can type/post your questions and get written answers from staff/TAs.
The obvious choice for such a forum is the [Canvas Discussions section] (/courses/27/discussion_topics) but unfortunately that doesn't work since, despite repeatedly asking us to post our questions there, none of the staff/TAs monitor/answer any of our questions there, making it useless.
Eg. A discussion thread was created for QKD ([link] (/courses/27/discussion_topics/863?wrap=1)) and we were asked to post our QKD-related questions there -- however, nobody bothered to actually answer any of our questions, making the entire thing pointless. In fact, the only people who responded to any of our questions were other students!
[no-answers-to-our-questions-1.png] (/users/15960/files/24103/preview?verifier=pW18ho17bMg6CFUmAaBeVXMQ5srz1rBEjZZQ1Fxh)
In summary:

* For people who cannot attend office hours, there needs to be a forum where students can post their questions at any time and get written answers from staff/TAs

* If the [Canvas Discussions section] (/courses/27/discussion_topics) is meant to be that forum, the staff/TAs need to actually commit to monitoring it and answering everyone's questions -- there is no point in asking us to post our questions there and then ignoring them!

* Being able to watch lecture recordings is very helpful, especially if you weren't able to attend the live lecture. Unfortunately, currently the recordings suffer from a lack of quality control, which undercuts their usefulness -- specifically, whenever the live lecture has an issue, for some reason the lecturers do not re-record the lecture to fix that issue, and instead just blindly post the faulty recording online despite knowing that it has issues.
Eg.:

* For the entire first half of [lecture 3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKckCAsJA58&lc=UgzOMJadn_5MzI9ZgkN4AaABAg), the lecturer had an issue with his microphone which meant that we could not hear what he was saying. Despite everyone trying to let the lecturer know in the Zoom chat right away, for some reason the TA only brought this to his attention during the mid-lecture break, after which he replaced his microphone.
The problem is that, although the lecturer and staff were now well aware that the first half of the lecture was practically unusable, they went ahead and posted that recording  anyway. Instead, to ensure students could actually follow the lecture, they should have re-recorded the first half of the lecture such that it was actually audible and only then posted that new version of the lecture online.

* When filming [lecture 10] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSJtrVSTJA4&lc=Ugwt-7bg08e34fC5-Bl4AaABAg.9jG7muCUOY39jMaoJiHz8t), the staff accidentally forgot to hit the ""Record"" button at the start of the lecture, and only remembered to do so after ~10 mins. Despite being well aware that the first 10 mins of lecture were now missing, they went ahead and posted this incomplete recording online, which meant that any students who were not able to attend the live lecture now had no way of catching up on those first 10 mins!

In summary, to ensure the lecture recordings are good enough to teach students who could not attend the lecture live, the lecturers and staff need to be willing to put in the effort to re-record the lectures when something goes wrong instead of just blindly uploading recordings that they know are flawed.
Otherwise, students can never really rely on the lecture recordings since they have no confidence that, if the live lecture has issues, those issues will be corrected in the subsequent recording.

* It would be great if the course could provide more opportunities for us to talk to our fellow students and get to know them. For example, maybe we could have group assignments, group activities during lab, etc.

* In lecture, it was briefly mentioned that the H gate can be thought of as performing a change in basis, but we were not given a lot of details and, instead, were basically told not to think about it too much as it involved math. I personally found this very confusing and hard to understand. Instead, either:

* a) More time should have been spent explaining what this means, how this works, etc.  without advanced math, so that people could actually understand it
OR

* b) If there was not enough time to adequately explain what this meant, or if it was not possible to explain it without advanced math, it should not have been mentioned in the first place.
Bringing it up but refusing to properly explain it seems like the worst of both worlds.",0.0,"For Amir: The lecturer is clearly very smart, but I feel like he has a tendency to:

* Go through the material REALLY fast

* Casually throw out technical jargon, references to advanced Physics experiments, etc. that we don't know

Instead, it would be great if he could make more of an effort to slow down and avoid jargon / technical references that we don't know, keeping in mind that we are new to all of this.",0.0,5,4,2.0

I really wanted lab class so if that could go beyond 60 minutes, I would spend more time on coding.

modules I checked after 7 weeks. assignments were confusing in beginning "" how to upload assignments""

The coding school account detail should be explained in video for newcomers. I had problems in starting 4 weeks to understand that. I know there is no real human behind this canvas to help. so we learn after mistakes.

But at the end I loved zoom classes which changed my entire way of view. Not I take great interest in Quantum Computing. I watch more YouTube videos about that. I know I will collect endless information about that.

What i liked most was the live labs with a grad student which gave me time to learn the material practically. I could ask questions and get good answers in live time which for me is a very important part of my learning since i ask a lot of questions.

 ",0.0,"I would like to say thanks for the time and effort put in by the TA every week along side of other commitments. It has been a great semester and i have really enjoyed the live labs. 

 

But also thanks to the rest of the team in helping the course run smoothly and creating a vibrant environment for students to study and share ideas. It has been a great experience so far and i am extremely looking forward to semester 2 and hopefully a successful future in quantum. 

 

In addition, i am curious as to how a UK physics undergrad could jump into the quantum scene in the USA once graduated. I have not had much time to surf around for information since starting this course as my degree is demanding. If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be amazing. 

 

Thank you!
