Making lab days less packed with things to get through and more step by step coding information and processes for the beginners taking this course.
No
I believe this course allowed me to excel in both STEM and artificial intelligence. I never realized how much I would be interested in these topics and now I am extremely happy I chose to participate in this course.
This course has recently made me prioritize things and activities in my life which was difficult in the beginning, but has progressed sense.
No. Everything was great. 
There is not much I have to say. Only just a better integration of the powerpoints with the lab notebook is all.

Thank you for this semester! Have a good Christmas. 
great course, enjoyable, and has great instructors

One suggestion that I might make would be to anchor the attendance code for labs in a section of the screen that would not obstruct the overall lab as it can be hard to get the attendance code when joining the lab even slightly late.

I would love if the coding school had a list of resources for us detailing summer programs related to AI, how to do our own passion projects, and ways to transfer what we are learning into more things to develop our confidence with ML/AI and our resumes. 
No

It is really useful, Thank you for teaching me all of this information.
this course is a lot of fun :)

A review of the course so far.
I believe that for beginning classes the pacing should be slowed down.
It was really fun and it makes me feel kind of proud of myself because now I can say that I know the basics of machine learning and how it works to an extent.
No, I really like it so far though.
No thank you! This has been awesome!

Adding a way to set up one on one video calls would be a good Idea.
No
What I found particularly interesting are decision trees, as they at first seem particularly simple, being a system that chooses from a Yes/No question, to then branching out from those Yes and No answers to even more specific questions. And how a certain extent of the tree could possibly impact your results, and knowing when you have to prune it all down.

Nope. 
No, just want to thank my TA and the team for giving me a second chance to do better

Please either more time in lab or less repetitive practice. 
I love the lectures and labs.
no
I really enjoyed the course and would recommend it to others. I would suggest more material to work with, but not as a grade.
This course really highlighted the importance of data analysis and statistics within STEM.
Nope.
I just want to let you guys know that since my school has been off on Christmas break I’ve been working hard to catch up and I’m planning on being much more responsible with work going into the second semester. I have to catch up because I thought I could drop out due to the workload. After missing several weeks, I received an email saying I could not drop out since I had signed the contract. Although it has been tough trying to catch up, I’m greatful for the second chance. Thank you for your leniency, and happy holidays!
no :)

I am fine with the course.

 
Maybe we can touch on deep learning at the end of the course, or maybe have a lecture with a guest speaker on deep learning.

Overall it's been a really fun and insightful experience!
I think more time developing fundamental ideas and math would have been better, as then later you could go through algorithms quicker(and more complex ones) and with more depth. As it is I thought the course repeated itself a lot, which is good for reinforcement but redundant if you follow along consistently. I think setting a stronger foundation would reduce the need for the redundancy 
Thank you for teaching this course!
I am enjoying the course

I really like this course overall, but the recent homework has been a lot more stressful. I do my best with filling out the google colab sheet, but sometimes im not 100% sure about the answers on the survey and there isn’t a way to tell which ones are wrong (without going through the survey a bunch of times and changing one answer each time). I understand that it’s probably been changed so that it’s easier to grade and to make sure people are doing the work, it can just feel frustrating when you are doing the work and trying really hard to learn the material but you can improve your score on the surveys.
No
not really?
Sometimes the lab notebooks have errors in them that we encounter often in labs. Just some more proofreading in them would clear a lot of confusion. 
No, thank you.
nope it is a great course.
I understood the coding aspect however, I would have liked more practice in data interpretation. 
I really enjoyed this course and I learned so much that will benefit me in the future.
More opportunities for community bonding. Possibly some connections to internships, that would be helpful.
So far, the course seems great!
No
no
I would like to thank you for your dedication in helping students learn machine learning. I enjoyed this course and will definitely tune in for 2nd semester! :)
I wish we had spent more time with decision trees, they were really cool to work with for me. 
Nope.
I don't have anything to add
I think the course was very interesting and I learned a good amount of the topics that was taught, and still wish to learn more in the next semester. 
I enjoyed the course very much and had fun attending lab sessions and completing homework assignments. I am so happy to be in this course and have amazing lab instructors! :)
No
I really enjoy this course and I am thankful for the recent review days as they really helped me grasp what we learnt during the semester. 
I hope to learn more in the future about coding and machine learning! I am also thankful for this opportunity to learn coding in such a relaxed manner!
Im happy to say that I enjoy this course, Keep up the good work!
No, there is nothing else that I would like to add regarding my view of the course, what I learned, or any suggestions. 
Nope, I thought this program was a wonderful experience, and I appreciate this opportunity to learn more about computer science and AI machine learning.  I look forward to next semester. Thank you all for your hard work and your contributions to helping students like me develop more in the field of STEM. 
Can't think of anything :)
Nope
I'm glad I took this course! I learned new AI & ML terminology, how to work with AI, and what could be done with it. I could tell the course was meant to improve college readiness because some of the material I learned crossed over into my dual credit courses at the University of Texas at Arlington, particularly regarding binary trees. Thank you for all your hard work!
Not currently.
I really enjoyed this course. Although I though I missed some labs due to personal issues, the office hours were a good way to ask more question and help needed which was helpful
I really liked the structure of the course 
maybe simpler explanations of concepts for those with a lower intuition for some of the trickier lessons
I like how the course allows you to ask questions if needed.

i have basically had my first real exposure to ML and AI. as a result, i am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to join this course and receive access to amazing materials.
I'm very grateful for this course, it has made me a lot more interested in AI.
Nothing 
nope
no
I think it would be nice if there was a way to get the correct code for the homework after submitting it, I've found that occasionally my outputs from the homework don't match what the homework survey says is correct and its a little frustrating as, as far as I can tell, I wrote the code correctly and it lines up with the cheatsheet but wont give me the answer I'm supposed to be getting.
No
None.
some sort of lab involving data we collect ourselves
I really liked this course so far. The only suggestion I have for the future is adding another lecture time in case you have something else at those times.
I don't have any suggestions at the moment but overall you guys were extremely helpful over this semester and I'm excited for the next one.

I think you guys are doing a really good job, and I hope next semester I won't need to miss any lectures or labs due to sickness
none
If it could be implemented, the creation of a review session after each quarter of learning would be pretty beneficial for many. Aside from that, I appreciate The Coding School's team that has dedicated their time and effort into teaching us such a wonder!
No
I do suggest adding more extra credit opportunities, such as an individual Machine Learning project. 
no
Can you have a vocab list of all the major topics we have learnt?
I hope that this course continues to be free so that more people can learn about AI and Machine Learning!
I really enjoyed this semester of the course, and I feel like I learned a lot about ML!
Just to reiterate, I would love to have either a hackathon or team-based programming projects so that students may be able to interact with each other more! (also allows us to apply what we've learned with greater retention)
A suggestion I would like to add is adding more time on labs because in the end of labs it would be rushed if there wasn't enough time, and even a little more time would probably help a lot.
I understand this is a beginner course, but I believe that I would learn better if the labs were not just how to use a library, and more how to create the model from a lower level. IE, making the model ourselves.
I believe that this is an excellent course, that has given me a window into the previously mystical world of AI and I am excited to begin again in the Spring. 
I would enjoy seeing internship or further learning opportunities given to students through this program. 
This is great because we can learn on our own time and I is very easy to reach out for help.

N/A, everything y'all are doing is to my best appreciation. 
There's nothing in particular that I would like to add to my view of the course, except it does take time for me to learn some of the content and a lot of trial and error. Regardless, I have a positive learning attitude and I am always looking forward to learning new stuff from great instructors.
Overall, I have found this course extremely enjoyable and helpful in learning machine learning and strengthening my knowledge in STEM fields. 
Nope
Nothing more to add.
I find this course to be interesting and beneficial. I look forward to learning more next semester.
No. 
No, I think this course was very informative and well taught!
No, I am very happy with my experience in the couse.
My high school only offers 1 computer science class, so being able to learn in depth about AI is very enjoyable.
No, I like the way the course has been so far.
No 
I enjoyed taking the course because it helped me learn about information typically not included in a normal high school curriculum.
no, I've enjoyed the course so far :) thank you!
No
Not at the moment. I felt like this first semester was excellent! I look forward to learning even more, especially the technical and programming side!

 
no 
Nope.
I don't know.
I have loved the course so far to be honest. It's kind of hard to be on zoom and doing it outside of school but I like the challenge. I am committed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for lacrosse and plan on pursuing a degree in Computer Science. This course has expanded my knowledge in AI and Machine Learning and has opened my mind to new possibilities. 
not particularly
No. 
Are we going to learn about python in the next semester?
No

 
The course is fun
One helpful thing would be large-scale projects given that we attempt and complete by ourselves - something that we are interested in. With the help of TAs and others, we can create a final product that is useful and helpful for a purpose. This will help us learn ML much better and without any given code.
I would love to get into more of the mathematical and statistical side of ML
No.
make it a bit easier to understand
Well I would just like to say that I learned more in this course than before when I only knew how to program but not the processes that go behind it.
no
I feel like this first semesters concepts were hard and I couldn't really understand much and code a lot.
I really enjoyed this course and am looking forward to the next semester!
I'm really happy with what I've been learning so far! Also the pacing is great... the class is challenging but doesn't go too fast. The only thing that is slightly frustrating is the homework quiz... a lot of questions don't account for natural randomness between models, and I've gotten many questions wrong but I'm not sure why, so it would be great if there was some automatic feedback after submitting a quiz, to learn from my mistakes. Other than that, looking forward to the second semester!
no
In terms of the lectures, if they can be illustrated in a more exciting way, that would be great. In terms of homework, more adding a little more detail so that each topic isn't vaguely specified. For quizzes, sometimes questions and answers aren't clear and can lead to confusion when trying to complete them, if there was more detail or more quality there that would be fantastic. 
No, I learned a lot and have no suggestions
Like I said above, I feel like it would help if the lab was longer and the lectures were shorter. Thanks
Maybe more examples in the cheat sheets on specifically how to do it. Sometimes i get stuck and i’ll out in what i know and what’s in the cheat sheet but having atleast one question answered for me i can do the rest. 
Nope! Thank you for offering this class :)
none

I would like that labs are reserved for practicing what is learned in lecture.
No
No
More inteactions during lab -- perhaps make cameras on a thing/highly encouraged (i.e. extra credit or something), to increase interactivity?
Nope, I think it's a good course.
It has been great and I'm learning a lot! 
Not at this point.
I like it a lot.
No
I feel like when we started learning about decision trees, the code started getting a lot more difficult than before.
I prefer my lectures over labs. I think the labs are too fast and is not beginner friendly now :((
Adding more lab/lecture time would make the course feel more complete. Sometimes, the lab feels rushed. 
More engaging labs - right now it's mostly just following the presentation, doing problems on our own, then sharing answers in chat
Keep being awesome!
Thanks for all your hard work!
While I feel like I am learning more about coding and the concepts of a coding language, I feel that it would be more helpful in labs and the weekly lecture to talk more about the concepts and functionality of code. I feel like just learning the syntax to do a specific task is not necessarily the best way to learn how to use a coding language. 
The lab notebooks and homework notebooks are really cool! I had never heard of Google Collab before this course.
I am enjoying the course.
